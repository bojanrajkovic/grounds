      # Cache pnpm store manually instead of using setup-node's built-in cache.
      # Rationale: mise-action already installs Node from mise.toml. Adding
      # setup-node would install Node twice, wasting time and resources.
      # Manual caching gives us the benefits of package caching without duplication.
